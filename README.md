# Truth in Traces  

A Windows Vulnerability and Network Scanner for Forensic Security Analysis

Truth in Traces is a powerful tool designed to aid forensic investigators and cybersecurity professionals in detecting system vulnerabilities, analyzing network configurations, and generating real-time forensic scan reports. Built using React (frontend) and Flask (backend), this tool is tailored to streamline forensic audits and security assessments on Windows systems.


## Features

-  Real-time system info and vulnerability scanning
-  Role-based login with JWT authentication
-  Open ports and firewall rule analysis
-  PDF report generation with system and scan details
-  Live scan logs via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
-  Scan history saved to MongoDB with viewing support
-  Clean and responsive React dashboard (with dark mode support)


## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js (Bootstrap)
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Database: MongoDB
- PDF Report: ReportLab / xhtml2pdf (PDF generation)
- Real-time Logs: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- CVE Lookup: NVD API for real-time CVE data

## How to Run

### Backend (Flask)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Flask server:

python app.py
Make sure MongoDB is running and credentials are configured in .env.

 Frontend (React)
Navigate to frontend folder:

cd frontend
Install dependencies:

npm install
Start development server:

npm run dev
 Deployment Notes
You can deploy the frontend on Vercel/Netlify and backend on Render/Heroku or use Docker for combined deployment.

Email credentials, MongoDB URI, and CVE API keys must be secured using environment variables.
